# One night a man was walking into a dark alley as he walks he starts hearing a strange sound turning around the corner he sees a strange skeleton like being hunched over a body eating it. The man walked backwards hitting a can the skeleton turned around slowly looking at the man's direction. The man quickly turned around starting to run but the skeleton was faster as the skeleton and the man fell down he looks at the skeleton's empty eye sockets. The skeleton tilted his head and opened his mouth slowly last thing the man saw was the darkness that the skeleton's mouth was filled with.
